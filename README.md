# ShopifyProdEng Summer 2022 Coding Challenge

TO RUN:
_____________________________________
Clone the repository on your PC, and proceed to import the parent folder into VSCode or a similar IDE. 

The main function is called from ShopApplication.java, but before the program is run, Spring Boot must be installed.

Spring Boot can easily be installed using VSCode's built-in extension marketplace. Once installed proceed to run code.


Next, open up a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox and go to the local server web app at:
http://localhost:8080/shop 




DESCRIPTION:
_______________________________________
This 'shop' has several functions that the user may interact with, including the main GUI, and corresponding web app that displays the shop inventory.

The GUI displays albums along with their price, and can be added or deleted to a users cart. 

A user may 'check-out' if they have items in their cart, 
and the store inventory will decrease upon refreshing the inventory web app at http://localhost:8080/shop. 

Checking out will close the program automatically.

The code is heavily commented to assist with understanding key components and lines.
